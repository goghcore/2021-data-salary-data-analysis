# Global Data Professional Salary Analysis Project
## Project Goal
This personal project aims to identify factors that influence data professional salaries & determine how those factors impact salaries based on the data in the Annual Global Data Professional Salary Survey in 2019.
## Data
The Annual Global Data Professional Salary Survey conducted in 2019 collected responses from 882 data professionals across 46 countries. The dataset contains various information such as salary, education, years of experience in data jobs, hours of work per week, and other related variables.

The dataset is available in this repository [here](data/original-data/2021-data-professional-salary-survey-responses.xlsx).

_Note: The data in the survey was self-reported and may contain biases or errors._

## Result & Recommendations
The analysis reveals that years of experience with the primary database or in data jobs are not reliable indicators of salary levels. Other factors, such as weekly working hours and number of databases, as well as categorical factors like primary database, job title, and education level, may impact salary. Future analysis should consider these factors to comprehensively assess the various factors that may impact salary.
