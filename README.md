# Global Data Professional Salary Analysis Project
## Project Goal
This personal project aims to identify factors that influence data professional salaries & determine how those factors impact salaries based on the data in the Annual Global Data Professional Salary Survey in 2019.
## Data
The Annual Global Data Professional Salary Survey conducted in 2019 collected responses from 882 data professionals across 46 countries. The dataset contains various information such as salary, education, years of experience in data jobs, hours of work per week, and other related variables.

The dataset is available in this repository [here](data/original-data/2021-data-professional-salary-survey-responses.xlsx).

_Note: As the population data are estimates, the sum of the numbers from the different age groups may not sum up to the total._
## Result & Recommendations
**In response to state risk:** Vulnerable people are at risk of flu-related complications & death. States with large percentages of vulnerable population should be prioritized (e.g. California, Florida, New York).

**Proactive staffing:** To ensure that medical centers have enough staff to handle the increase in patients during the peak months of December through March, the medical staffing agency should start sending staff to medical centers before December, ideally in November.
